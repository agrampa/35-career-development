## Hash Tables

Hash tables are used as a way to store data in an organized way. For example, letters can be converted to ASCII, then hashed to a specific index of the array. If more than one input evaluates to the same key, known as a key collision, the index of the array is represented as a doubly-linked list of the keys at that specific index.
